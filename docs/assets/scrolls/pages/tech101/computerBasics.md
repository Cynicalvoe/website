_The parts of a computer, how the Internet works, dangers to be aware of, and how to be smart with tech._

## Introduction
So you finally got that new laptop, and you'd like to learn more about it? I'm glad you're here!

This guide will cover the basics of what a computer is, along with some related ideas to give you even more context.

## Parts of a Computer
Almost every computer around has several parts inside, which work together to let the computer do its job. These parts can be found inside laptops, desktops, smartphones, and much more.  
While we won't go into all of them, let's get a bird's eye view on some of the more important ones:

### The Processor
The Processor, often called the **CPU** (or Central Processing Unit), is the "brain" of the computer. The Processor is like a delivery driver, taking data from around the computer and figuring out where it needs to go and how it's going to get there. Processors tend to be expensive because of how important they are. The fastest Processors are the most expensive, due to the components built inside them.

Two of the most important things to note about Processors are their **Clock Speed** and their **number of Cores**:
- Clock Speed is the number of instructions the Processor can handle each second. Think of this as how fast a delivery truck can drive on the road. The higher the Clock Speed, the faster the Processor. This speed is measured in Gigahertz (GHz).
- Processors are made up of "Cores," which are like the delivery trucks in our earlier example. The more delivery trucks you have, the more packages you can deliver at the same time. Processor Cores work the same way - the more Cores you have, the more
instructions can be worked on at the same time.

**Wrap-up**  
One delivery truck that can drive at 50mph is going to deliver fewer packages than _three_ trucks that can each drive at 100mph. Makes sense, right?  
Similarly, a Processor with **2 Cores** that runs at **1.0GHz** is going to be _much slower_ than a Processor with **4 Cores** and runs at **3.0GHz**.

### Memory
Memory, also known as **RAM** (or Random Access Memory), is very important for computers - and not because they have trouble remembering where they left their car keys! Memory is what lets your computer multitask. The more Memory you have, the more "chunks" of data it can work with at the same time.

> Note: Memory like this is not the same as Storage space! We'll get into that a little bit later.

**Let's start with an example:**  
Pretend you had a tall stack of paper. Your boss needs you to add a stamp to the top of every paper in the stack. You also happen to have a very small desk, with enough space to stamp one piece of paper at a time. In order to do your job, you'll need to take one piece of paper off the top, move it to your desk, add your stamp, and move the paper back into a new pile for all the stamped copies.

Depending on how big the stack of papers is, this could take a few minutes, or it could take all day. And who gives their employees a tiny desk, anyway?

Now let's pretend your boss was a kind person, and they gave you a very large desk the next day. This new desk can easily fit 20 pieces of paper at a time, so you can stamp them all a lot faster. Compared to yesterday, you completed the stack of papers in a fraction of the time.

**Wrap-up**  
In this example, Memory is like the **size of your desk**. The bigger the desk, the more things the computer can "stamp" at a time. Nice! And for extra credit, remember the Processor? **Clock Speed** is like how many pieces of paper you can stamp in one second. If you added a coworker to help you stamp papers on your desk, this is like adding another **Core**. 

### Storage
Another component in every computer is the Storage drive. Often called an **HDD** (Hard Disk Drive), an **SSD** (Solid State Drive), or simply a **Hard Drive**, this is where your digital files live. The larger your Storage space, the more files you can fit onto it. Therefore, the more you can keep on your computer.

Storage space today is measured in Gigabytes (GB). Bytes are tiny pieces of information, and a Gigabyte is equal to about 1,000,000,000 of them. Here's a short list of the most common storage amounts:
- Terabyte (1,000 Gigabytes)
- Gigabyte (1,000 Megabytes)
- Megabyte (1,000 Kilobytes)
- Kilobyte (1,000 Bytes)

### Operating System
The final piece of a computer that you should know is the **OS** (or Operating System). The Operating System isn't like the other parts, however - it is a piece of software, which you now know is stored on a hard drive.

The Operating System's role is to do several things. The biggest job for an OS is to show a screen or interface for you to look at, interact with, and use to do _your_ job. The Operating System is what lets you set a password, change your wallpaper, install programs and games, type up documents, and much more. It also needs to balance a lot of technical tasks behind-the-scenes so the computer works as intended. We won't go into those tasks here, but there is a link at the bottom with more details if you're interested.

There are a lot of different operating systems out there, so here are 3 of them:

- **Windows**: Developed by Microsoft, Windows is the most common Operating System today.
- **macOS**: Developed by Apple, macOS comes pre-installed on all Mac computers. It used to be known as Mac OS X.
- **Linux**: Linux is a free Operating System, and is used in a lot of different products. It's more technical in nature, so you don't find a lot of personal computers with Linux installed.

## The Internet
Let's move on from the parts of a computer and talk about the Internet.

The Internet, in all its glory, is just a group of computers that are connected to each other. You already know what the Internet does, so let's take a short look at how it works!

You probably pay a company for Internet Service. These **ISP**s (or Internet Service Providers) connect your home to their own networks, which are in turn connected to other networks, and so on. Service Providers do more as well, but connecting you to the network is the most important thing they offer, which is why they charge a fee.

### Websites
Now that you're on the Internet, what do you do? Websites are also on the Internet, and you only need to know their names in order to visit them. But how does your computer do that?

The answer is a little complicated, but there are 3 main steps that are needed to visit a website:
1. Your computer finds the "location" of the website you want to visit (this is the **IP Address**, and everybody has a different one).
2. A message is sent to the **IP Address** of the website, and the website responds with some data.
3. Your computer receives the data, and displays it in your **web browser**.

## What About Viruses?
You've probably heard about them. The mysterious bugs that cause problems in a computer - some can be fixed, and others destroy a computer entirely. But what are they?

Viruses are programs on a computer that do a number of things when they get installed. Some of them show advertisements, some send emails to your friends and family, some give hackers access to your files, and some ask for money in order to be removed.
The common thing between all of these kinds of Viruses, however, is that they must first be installed. Viruses aren't magic, and if they were, everybody would have them. Thankfully, there are lots of ways to protect your computer from them, as seen in the next section.

Viruses get installed in a number of ways:
- They trick you into downloading them by pretending to be something else
- They get included in files, emails, and thumb drives, which came from an infected computer
- A hacker installed it themselves

## Tips to Stay Safe
Here are some tips to keep you safe online:

### Security Checklist
I highly recommend viewing the [Security Checklist](https://securitycheckli.st/) - a free website that helps you view tips to secure your data.

### Viruses
If you think your computer has a virus, the best thing to do is to **not panic** - as mentioned before, most viruses can be removed by a professional. Contact a local computer repair shop that you trust, a family member, or a friend to help you.

Installing an antivirus program can also help reduce the chances of getting a virus. Products from AVG, Avast, and Bitdefender are some  reputable choices.

**Some Viruses are a scam, and want you to call their phone number for support**. If your computer is telling you to call someone so they can fix it, it's likely a scam. The phone number will connect you with the hacker, who pretends to repair the computer, and then charges you a large amount of money for the fake service. Going to somebody that you trust will help you avoid being fooled.

### Passwords
- Always set a password, if you are able
- Never reuse the same password twice
- Never write your passwords down on paper
