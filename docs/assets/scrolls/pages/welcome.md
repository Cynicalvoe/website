# Welcome to Scrolls
Hi there!

Scrolls is a new section on the site dedicated to guides and information. I hope to add to the library as I discover new topics to write about, and I hope others like you can benefit from them!

**The Goal**: To explain complex stuff in simple guides, called "Scrolls"  
There are lots of things worth sharing, but some of them are hard to understand. Each Scroll is intended to be simple, so that anybody can use it.

Interested in what I have to share? Take a look at the list of Scrolls on this page, and click or tap on the one you'd like to read about.  
If a Scroll helped you learn something, please feel free to share the link with others!  
If you feel a Scroll can use improvement, you're welcome to use the Contact link to send me a note so I can make corrections. And if you have an idea for a future Scroll, I'd love to hear about that as well!
