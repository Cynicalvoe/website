# Work-From-Home Tips
##### edited February 25, 2021

_My learnings, tips, and recommendations for virtual work gained during the COVID-19 pandemic._

## Introduction
As I write this, the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed my team and I into our home offices full-time for over 12 months. Instead of throwing an anniversary party-for-one, I thought I would draft up a list of tips and lessons learned during this historical time.

Personally, I greatly appreciate the flexibility and collaboration potential of virtual work, and the thought of returning to an office cubicle continues to grow more and more unexciting. Since I am not the only one to have invested in my home workspace, I begin to question what the future of all corporate work arrangements will be when this pandemic is over.

For now, however, I thought I would share some of my thoughts, learnings, and grievings after 12 months of working from home.

## #1: Communication
The IT field has famously relied on strong communication skills for a while, but now other departments are having to catch up. Because communication is so key to virtual work of all kinds, it's important to put your best effort into how you use it.

### Learning: Casual Conversation
At the beginning of the pandemic, one of the biggest challenges for my team was finding time to see the human elements of each other. It's easy to get together and discuss work-related tasks, but the small-talk from office past was difficult to come by. Conversations got stale and direct, and the color of our work began to fade.

This was when we decided to schedule "open house" meetings, where team members could jump in and chat with each other about anything that came to mind. Having a block of time dedicated to maintaining relationships helped us relate better, and ultimately made collaboration easier and more comfortable for everyone.

### Grieving: Grammar
Perhaps one of the most surprising things to me at my job is the lack of proper grammar, even in formal emails. Having studied under a number of strict English teachers during my school years, good grammar is something I hold near and dear to my heart. As such, here are some common mistakes I have noticed, along with an explanation of why they are wrong and how to correct them.

#### Plurals vs. Possession
For any given word, adding `'s` shows **possession**, and adding `s` makes the word **plural**. Far too often, people will add `'s` to make a word plural, but this is not correct. In formal writing, confusing these two rules is a great way to damage your credibility and professionalism.
> Example: _John owns two red cars._  

In this example, "John" is the **subject**, "two red cars" is the **object**, and "owns" is the **verb conjugation**. The verb is correctly written as "owns," because it follows the Third Person Singular form of "to own." Meanwhile, "cars" is also correct, as it uses the plural version of "car."
> **(Incorrect)** Example: _John own's two red car's._  

This example is wrong because we are giving the **verb** ("to own") possession of the **object**, instead of to the **subject**. In addition, the **object** is written incorrectly as "car's," because it is assigning possession to "car."

This is not to say that apostrophes are bad, because they are incredibly useful! Here is an example sentence that uses apostrophes correctly:
> Example: _John's two red cars don't get used very often, because he's quarantining at home._

Apostrophes are always used in **contractions**, such as in "don't" and "he's". Contractions are shorthand for word pairs: "do not" becomes "don't," and "he is" becomes "he's."

## #2: Tech Savvy
Although I work in IT, there are many others in unrelated industries who have needed to adapt to online tools. Perhaps it's my personal bias, but I think everybody in the workforce today should have a fundamental understanding of how to use their devices. Not everyone is cut out for computer science, but knowing how to use the tools provided to you is a skill to succeed.

### Tip: Invest in Your Home Office
At the start of my work-from-home adventure, I had a small desk with mismatching monitors. While I could still use my computer, things got cramped and uncomfortable very quickly. It wasn't until I upgraded to a standing desk and a pair of larger monitors that working from home became much easier to accomplish. I have co-workers who have made this journey themselves, and they all say the same thing.

For those who have not yet changed their home workspace, they get frustrated when multitasking with different full-screen windows, and even find it difficult to view certain virtual presentations. Using a second display can practically double your efficiency, and in my experience, I can never go back to a single-display work mode.

### Grieving: Virtual Meeting Tools
It comes as no surprise that the COVID-19 pandemic required a lot of folks to learn new tools in a short amount of time. Of these, the most infamous is virtual meeting software: Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Slack are some examples. However, even 12 months later, there are still those out there who have yet to master the craft. Therefore, here are some of my personal grievances and ways to overcome them.

#### Can You See My Screen?
Screen-sharing has become a fact of life, and there is somebody streaming their desktop in almost every meeting I attend. However, some presenters still feel the need to ask the group "Can you see my screen?". The problems I have with this question are:
1. It takes time to ask and time to get a response.
2. It demonstrates a lack of awareness of your own presentation.
3. There are indicators within most virtual meeting software to answer this question for you.

In my opinion, **you should know how to share your screen, look for the indicators, and feel confident others are seeing what you do.** The most important of these, I think, are the screen-sharing indicators. Here are some support articles you can use to master the art of sharing content in a group call:

- [(Microsoft Teams) Show your screen during a meeting](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/show-your-screen-during-a-meeting-90c84e5a-b6fe-4ed4-9687-5923d230d3a7)
- [(Zoom) Sharing your screen content or second camera](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-content-or-second-camera)
- [(Slack) Share your screen with Slack calls](https://slack.com/help/articles/115003501303-Share-your-screen-with-Slack-calls)

#### I Think You're on Mute
Another issue that still plagues virtual calls is the Mute Button. When you're not aware of your mute status, it can be dreadfully disruptive to the meeting - regardless whether your microphone is on or off. Background and chewing noises disturb the call if you are unmuted, and speaking into a muted microphone is a waste of time. Being mindful of your Mute Button, your background noise, and your computer's audio setup can simultaneously make meetings run smoother, improve your meeting skills, and increase your credibility.

### Conclusion
Although there are many more experiences to share, I hope these two big ideas gave you some practical advice for your next email or meeting. Thank you for taking the time to read this page, and please share any thoughts or suggestions you may have.
