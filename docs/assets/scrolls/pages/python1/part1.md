# Python Programming I: Introduction
##### edited July 7, 2020

_Learning how to code using Python - the introduction._

## Welcome
Hey there, and welcome to a short series on programming with Python! This guide is intended for new programmers who want to get started writing their very first programs. Python is one of many programming languages you can learn, and I chose it for this series because of its simple syntax and cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Before we get started, it will help you to know a few things about computers. If you haven't already, I recommend checking out [my Computer Basics guide](./scrolls#computerBasics) first. If you feel ready to continue, then let's continue!

## Getting Started
Before we can write any code, you'll need to install the latest version of Python onto your computer. [You can use this link to download it](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The installer will give you the **Python Interpreter** (which we will cover later), and **IDLE** - Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment. Both of these things are required to run our code, so go ahead and take a moment to install them now.

### Opening IDLE
After the installation is finished, let's open a new IDLE window. If you're on Windows, you can find this in the Start Menu:

When IDLE opens, you'll find the Console (or Shell) window first. This is a quick way to run Python commands, view information about your code, and much more. That window looks like this:

![IDLE Shell](../assets/scrolls/media/python1/idle-console.png "IDLE Shell")

(The text in your Shell may look different than mine, depending on the version that you are using. That's okay!)

Congratulations! Python is ready to rock on your computer. The next links in this series will go into more detail for how to write your own programs, but for now you have everything you need.

Let's give Python a quick test to make sure everything's working properly. Why not use this time to write your first program? We'll keep it simple and put something in the Shell window. Type the following code into the Shell, next to the `>>>` symbol, and then press the Enter or Return key on your keyboard:

```Python
print("Hello, world!")
```

If everything goes well, your IDLE window should send you something back, like this:

![IDLE Hello World](../assets/scrolls/media/python1/idle-hw.png "IDLE Hello World")

Does the text look familiar? If so, then congrats again! You've written your very first program. You asked Python to `print` some text, which we decided would be `Hello, world!`. When we pressed Enter/Return, that's exactly what we saw get "printed" to the Shell. In our case, "print" simply means to write it out on the screen, and not to send it to a document printer.

We'll talk more about this code, and lots of other code, in the following sections. For now, it's time to sit back and appreciate the progress you've made so far!
