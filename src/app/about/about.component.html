    <h1>FAQs</h1>
    <p>Let's have a little Q&A! Here are some questions others have asked me, as well as a few more I've added in just for fun.</p>

    <app-dropexpand title="How did you get into programming?">
        <p>When I was 11, I discovered a program to create my own computer games. With it came a simple language that was perfect for
        beginners like me. From there, I taught myself Java in order to mod my Minecraft server, and thus the snowball started
        rolling.</p>
        <p>If you're looking to get started with programming, I recommend beginning with <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python</a>
        because of its simple syntax. I also recommend checking out
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Introduction-Computer-Science/dp/1590282752" target="_blank">this book</a> to
        get you started! #NotSponsored</p>

    <app-dropexpand title="Do you have any tutorials available?">
        <p>Yes! I've recently put together the <a [routerLink]="['../scrolls']">Scrolls</a> page, which is a collection of guides and
        tutorials written by me. Very beginner-friendly and growing all the time! I encourage you to check it out!</p>

    <app-dropexpand title="I love your website, where'd you get it?">
        <p>Thank you! This website was fully designed by me, so I didn't buy it from anywhere.</p>
    </app-dropexpand>
    <app-dropexpand title="Mac or PC?">
        <p>The short answer: Yes.</p>
        <p>The slightly longer answer: I own both, and I think both have their strengths and weaknesses. It's all about using the right tool for the job,
            and how easily you want to accomplish the task. I love my Mac, I've built my own PC, and I use both pretty regularly.

    <app-dropexpand title="What is your personality in 12 characters or less?">
        <p>INTJ-T / 5w4</p>

    <app-dropexpand title="Favorite Anime?">

    <app-dropexpand title="I have a million-dollar app idea! Will you make it for me?">
        <p>Unfortunately, I can't commit extra time to building new projects. If you have an idea for a new app/website, there are lots of
            development companies out there who will build it for you in a much more professional way. Or, you could give it a shot
            yourself! Trust me, it's easier than you think.</p>
    </app-dropexpand>
    <app-dropexpand title="Can I follow you on social media?">
        <p>The only social media account I possess is an Instagram account, which is kept private for close friends and family only. I do not
            have a Facebook / LinkedIn / Twitter page, and there are no plans to open one at this time.
