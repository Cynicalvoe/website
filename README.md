## Overview
This is the repository for my personal website, written in Angular and deployed via the `/docs` folder by Github Pages.

I've had a personal website for a while, though both the design and framework have changed over the years. When challenged to learn Angular for my job, I decided to rewrite my personal site in Angular as practice, and that is the state it's been in since.

Fonts are provided by Google Fonts, I've pulled some open-source background patterns from [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/), and this repository uses [Rafgraph's spa-github-pages](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages) system to route users accurately.

## Installation
If you're curious and want to set this site up locally, feel free to use the following directions:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
In a terminal, use `git clone https://github.com/hwdotexe/website.git`

### Step 2: Install Packages
You'll need to install the Node packages used within the project, so perform `npm install` within the project's directory after cloning.

### Step 3: You're Done!
To run the site locally, simply use `npm start`
